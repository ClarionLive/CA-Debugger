# Regression check: the add-in's JSON number reader, which decides WHICH THREAD a reply belongs to.
#
# Two ways this hurts, both silent:
#   - a "tid" read out of a nested array or a string value names the wrong thread, so good replies get
#     dropped as "another thread's" and rows sit on "...";
#   - a real Win32 thread id above Int32.MaxValue read as a signed int comes back null, and null means
#     UNSCOPED - so a reply the engine DID stamp is accepted as if it were for whatever thread is on
#     screen. That is the absent-means-unknown rule broken from the other side, and it would hit roughly
#     one thread id in two.
#
# Neither can be reached from the pad's node suites (they never parse) and neither shows up against a live
# debuggee, whose thread ids are usually small. So this compiles the REAL methods straight out of
# ClarionDebuggerService.cs - extracted by brace matching, the same trick tools/pad-dom.js uses on the
# page - and asserts them directly.

# ae5b678a stage 1. JsonVal used to search for "key": with no idea where strings start or end, and the page
# worked around that by ORDERING its payloads - untrusted content last - with the doc comment instructing
# every future payload to do the same.
#
# WHAT THAT WORKAROUND ACTUALLY BOUGHT, measured rather than assumed: against the page's real senders the
# OLD extractor reads every fixture below CORRECTLY. JSON.stringify escapes each quote in a value, so a
# procedure name carrying "line":9999 arrives as \"line\":9999 and never matches the search; and no sender
# hand-builds JSON, they all either stringify or send a delimiter-separated string. Quote injection through
# today's senders was NOT reachable. The cases the old extractor genuinely got wrong are in the next block.
#
# So this block is regression coverage, not an exploit: whatever a hostile debuggee puts in a procedure
# name, the page encodes it and the host must read back exactly what was sent. The debuggee is untrusted -
# those names come out of the target's TSWD debug info and return here when the user right-clicks a
# Procedures row - and stage 2 adds more senders to this path, which is why the order dependence goes now,
# while there are still few enough senders to check.
#
# The fixtures are not written here. They are produced by running debugger.html's REAL send() and its REAL
# breakonprocentry handler - both lifted out of the page - under node, with the page objects they touch
# stubbed. Two suites built on each side's imagination of the other cannot contradict each other, and this
